# introduction

## distributed wellbeing

Imagine a mechanism of voting that does not involve placing a pictogram on paper into a secure box for scrutiny by a single government. Imagine one that involves running the government software of your choice. Imagine concurrent governments and distributed nations.

## analysis of individuals

There exist useful metrics for analysis of individuals. These metrics can include measures of psychological and financial wellbeing. For the former, a simple measure could be sentiment analysis of social media expressions; for the latter, a simple measure could be somewhat similar to measurements of benefits needs. Proxy-trust networks can reduce uncertainties.

## distributed wellbeing

The metrics for description of individuals can be used to distribute wellbeing in various forms. One form could be alerts for and prioritisation of psychological treatment, be that for everything from treatment of depression to treatment of religious fundamentalism. Another form could be distribution of wealth via Bitcoin using a donated fund owned by the distributed wellbeing system.

## precidents

There exist multiple decentralised, distributed systems running on the internet. There is distributed currency in the form of Bitcoin, there is distributed communications in the form of Tox, there is distributed data in the form of BitTorrent and there is distributed information and interaction in the form of Tor and onion routing. Analysis of individuals and wellbeing can be distributed in a decentralised way.

## evolution of government

Revolution is hard and often unsuccessful. Evolution is easier and is more amenable to change and optimisation. Consider distributed wellbeing as the possible beginnings of an automated system of government that can run (to varying extents) concurrently with existing government and other distributed wellbeing systems.

## project goals

A goal of this project is to collate thoughts and methods of describing individuals in terms of wellbeing needs, with two possible metrics being psychological wellbeing and financial wellbeing. Another goal of this project is to create free, open software that is decentralised and capable of analysis of individuals and automated flagging and prioritisation of psychological wellbeing needs and automated receipt of and distribution of wealth.
