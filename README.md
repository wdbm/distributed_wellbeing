*It can't be bargained with; it can't be reasoned with; it doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear, and it absolutely will not stop, ever, until wellbeing is distributed.*

# introduction

## distributed wellbeing

Imagine a mechanism of voting that does not involve placing a pictogram on paper into a secure box for scrutiny by a single government. Imagine one that involves running the government software of your choice, and consider that, fundamentally, government is a form of technology, with contemporary governments being made up of artificial machines and humans. Imagine concurrent governments and distributed nations. Imagine what basic infrastructure would be needed to ensure protection of all of those concurrent governments and distributed nations.

## precidents

There exist multiple decentralized, distributed systems running on the internet. There is distributed currency in the form of Bitcoin, there is distributed communications in the form of Tox, there is distributed data in the form of BitTorrent and there is distributed information and interaction in the form of Tor and onion routing and ZeroNet. Analysis of individuals and wellbeing can be distributed in a decentralized way.

## evolution of government

Revolution is hard and often unsuccessful. Evolution is easier and is more amenable to change and optimisation. Consider distributed wellbeing as the possible beginnings of an automated system of government that can run (to varying extents) concurrently with existing government and other distributed wellbeing systems.

## project goals

A goal of this project is to collate thoughts and methods of describing individuals in terms of wellbeing needs, with two possible metrics being psychological wellbeing and financial wellbeing. Another goal of this project is to create free, open software that is decentralized and capable of analysis of individuals and automated flagging and prioritisation of psychological wellbeing needs and automated receipt of and distribution of wealth.

## authentication

It is likely that the system shall need to ensure that there is one client instance per person. For this, a digital identity like Estonian e-Residency may be needed. 

## experimentation

The system should be able to experiment and to make a leap of faith into something new. It should not simply consider past behaviours because that could lead to stable stagnation.

## legal

### tax exemption on gifts

One possible legal complication of implementing a combined wallet that acts as a sort of shared fund is taxation on transferring funds. In the UK, gifts of up to £250 can be made to an unlimited number of people. Perhaps this can be used to distribute contributions to the distributed system.

Gifts to help with living costs of an ex-spouse, an elderly dependent or someone under age 18 or in fulltime education are exempt from taxation. Gifts from surplus income may be exempt. If one has enough income to maintain one's usual standard of living, one can make gifts from from that surplus income. An example might be a parent paying into their child's savings account. It may be necessary for the gift to be regular.

To make use of exemptions, excellent records must be kept of gifts.

Charitable gifts can be tax exempt. Could distributed_wellbeing be a charity?

### capital gains tax

Capital gains tax can be required on transfer of capital gains on assets of £6,000 or more. Capital gains tax is not paid on betting, lottery or pools winnings.

## security

The open source character of distributed_wellbeing is a sort distributed security for the activities of the system. It might make sense to distribute security of funds. This might take the form of every member defining a wallet which is used for the purposes of the system. Perhaps the private key of the wallet is created in such a way that it is accessible to the member (or the system?) only if the member and the system both agree for it to be accessible to the member (or the system?), at which point the part of the private key held by the system and the part of the private key held by the member are combined mathematically. If a member dies, perhaps their funds are lost (which could be an incentive to try to prevent members dying) or perhaps another member can be assigned by the system to hold a backup copy of the part of the private key held by the member.

# government ideologies

Perhaps it is useful to consider a base class for governments and other cooperative legal structures, one that enables a very great degree of freedom on which more constrained governments can be built. For example, on something like an anarchist or libertarian base class could be built more socialist or communist governments and social contracts which one can join voluntarily.

# inflation and deflation

Having multiple currencies has its benefits; if one currency is failing (such as the Venezuelan bolívar currently) people can jump to another currency backed by an alternative ideology, and it is getting easier to do this. Deflationary currencies can be beneficial in encouraging people to be careful to spend only on worthwhile things but they don't have the small protections against people who hoard wealth offered by inflationary currencies. In practice, wealthy people usually discover ways to store value that protect against inflation. Some ways are considered beneficial to societies, like investing, and other ways are considered detrimental, like holding empty properties. An option of an inflationary currency might offer some protections that would enable a new player to join the monopoly game more easily.

A simple inflation algorithm to disincentivize hoarding and to encourage economic activity could have all basic income payments issued as progressively larger amounts per unit time.

A more advanced inflation algorithm could behave as a sort of open source central bank or reserve, printing money in recession times in such an evidence-based way as to protect savings of everyone and economic activity as much as possible.

## some draft government ideologies

### draft government: SOL50

- SOL50: 50th anniversary of the Summer of Love

- "Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say. Nobody needs to justify why they 'need' a right. The burden of justification falls on the one seeking to infringe upon the right. You can't give away the rights of others because they're not useful to you. More simply, the majority cannot vote away the natural rights of the minority." -- Edward Snowden

There is an urgent need for a guaranteed unconditional universal basic income (UBI). The possibility of switching off "unemployment benefits" is incompatible with fundamental rights; this is sufficient motivation for UBI. Economically, the continuing rise of automation necessitates UBI. Socially, UBI will free people from economic dependence on others, whether that be in terms of activities in which they want to engage, or in terms of simple economic robustness, such as protecting children from the economic control of their parents or those people currently termed employers.

With a verified citizen unique identity, ideas like UBI could be implemented in a decentralized or distributed way, for example on Ethereum or Omni.

Information utilities like the internet could be shared. Consdier an excrypted shared mesh internet access network paid for by a decentralised or distributed automation.

#### analysis of individuals

There exist useful metrics for analysis of individuals. These metrics can include measures of psychological and financial wellbeing. For the former, a simple measure could be sentiment analysis of social media expressions; for the latter, a simple measure could be somewhat similar to measurements of benefits needs. Proxy-trust networks can reduce uncertainties.

### draft government: distributed_vulnerability

The metrics for description of individuals can be used to distribute wellbeing in various forms. One form could be alerts for and prioritisation of psychological treatment, be that for everything from treatment of depression to treatment of religious fundamentalism. Another form could be distribution of wealth via Bitcoin using a donated fund owned by the distributed wellbeing system.

#### A New Green Deal: climate change as the moral equivalent of war

The book *Utopia for Realists* by Rutger Bregman makes the statistical, economic and historical case for ending borders and implementing universal unconditional basic income. At a panel session Davos 2019, Bregman links the socio-economic benefits, such as reducing wealth inequality, of war-time with framing responses to climate change as a form of war. This is an inventive approach that could be investigated, because it offers both the possibility of addressing climate change in tandem with the possibility of improving social wellbeing.

# decentralization

In peer-to-peer decentralization, push technologies like UDP broadcasts can be used, whereby each client sends a heartbeat packet every so often on the network for others to receive. The module socket is useful for this.

Bitcoin clients use several methods to locate other clients. A primary method is to use a list of nodes from a previous connection to the network. This works well generally for all connections except for the first connection and a connection that follows a long time of disconnection. With no local list of nodes, DNS seeds, maintained hosts, can be queried. A hardcoded list of nodes can be considered also. An old method was to use an IRC server that worked in a way similar to that of BitTorrent trackers.
